# Contributing to MPC Designations

Thank you for your interest in MPC Designations!

## How This Project Works

This project provides MPC designation converters in multiple programming languages. Rather than accepting code contributions directly, the maintainer implements new languages and features based on community feedback.

**To suggest a new language implementation or feature:**
1. Open a GitHub issue describing your needs
2. Explain your use case and why the language/feature would be valuable
3. The maintainer will evaluate and implement suitable suggestions

This approach ensures consistency across all implementations and maintains the test coverage and validation standards the project requires.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. The input designation that caused the problem
2. Expected output
3. Actual output or error message
4. Which language implementation you're using
5. Your environment (OS, language version)

## Suggesting New Languages

When suggesting a new language, it helps to explain:

1. Your use case (astronomy pipeline, database integration, web application, etc.)
2. Whether you need the full implementation or just asteroid provisionals
3. Any specific API requirements for your environment

## Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Some examples of useful suggestions:

- "I need a function that validates without converting"
- "It would help to have batch processing for large files"
- "A streaming API would work better for my use case"

## Using the Code

All code is released under CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain). You may:

- Use it in any project (commercial or otherwise)
- Modify it for your needs
- Include it in your own software
- Use it without attribution (though attribution is appreciated)

## Project Standards

All implementations must:

1. Pass all 2,021,090+ conversion test cases
2. Pass all error handling test cases
3. Provide consistent APIs across languages where idiomatic
4. Include CLI tools for command-line use
5. Support both packed and unpacked format detection

## Questions?

Open an issue for questions about using the library or suggestions for improvements.
